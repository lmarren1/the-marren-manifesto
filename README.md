# The Marren Manifesto

## Purpose
Before I turn 35 years old, I want to complete **_10,000 hours_** of focused study/practice in computer programming.

## Motivation
### What it Comes Down to 
I want to master the craft of developing software. 

### Background
10,000 hours is a lot! So what the *heck* makes me think I can take on this enormous journey and why do I even want to?

Well, here's the short of it:

I have a passion for creating software. I believe dedicating myself to this discipline will be transformative for me, and not just as a programmer. I see it as a way to construct a beautiful life for myself by fusing my interests into a life-long career.

## Goals
### Overarching Goals
1. Achieve 10,000 hours of focused study/practice in developing software.

2. Create software for each one of my interests.

### Connecting My Interests Through Software

I have wide-ranging interests that I'd like to connect through software. These include:
- Tennis & Basketball
- Physical Fitness
- Math & Physics
- Electronics
- Languages
- Travelling
- Piano
- Aviation

By completing projects in these domains and continually improving myself as a developer, I believe I will ultimately make tangible use of a passion I've refined. And beyond that, maybe I'll be able to help others out and meet new people along the way!

## Timeline Breakdown 
### From Start to Finish 
From my official 'lock-in' date of September 1st, 2024 to my 35th birthday, there are:

| **Hours Per** | 730 | 61 | 14 | 2

### In the Day-to-Day 
Given the constraints of school and work, I will have to manage my time wisely! As such, I'll be adopting the following weekly schedule:

Weekdays | Weekends | Total
