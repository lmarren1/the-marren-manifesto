# Mastery Tracker

## Purpose
Before I turn 30 years old, I want to complete **_10,000 hours_** of focused study/practice in computer programming.

## Motivation
### What it Comes Down to 
I want to master the craft of developing software. 

### Background
At the time I'm writing this, I am a rising senior econometrics student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I have a **mediocre 3.3 GPA** and have received a **B-** and a **D** in the last two computer science courses 
I've taken.

So what the *heck* makes me think I can take on this enormous journey and why do I even want to?

Well, here's the short of it. Although I have little to show for my quantitative capabilities *right now*, I know I can achieve immense growth and success in engineering as a practice and an intellectual pursuit. 

In particular, I have a passion for creating software. I think dedicating myself to this discipline will be transformative for me, and not just as a programmer. I see it as a way to construct a beautiful life for myself by fusing my interests into a life-long career.

So why continue to sit around dreaming of a better life for myself when I can create it on my own laptop? I have work to do, and lots of it!

## Goals
### General Overview
For as lofty as completing the 10,000 hours before 30 is, my goals are even broader.

I have wide-ranging interests that I'd like to connect through software. These include:
- Tennis & Basketball
- Physical Fitness
- Math & Physics
- Electronics
- Languages
- Travelling
- Piano
- Aviation

By completing projects in these domains and continually improving myself as a developer, I believe I will ultimately make tangible use of a passion I've refined. And beyond that, maybe I'll be able to help others out and meet new people along the way!

### The First Four Months
My first goal is to get the ball rolling and begin with honing fundamentals. 

Specifically, I would like to:

1. Improve my use of version control with git and GitHub. 
2. Create small data science projects using Python, R, Excel, and Tableau.
3. Start re-learning precalculus and calculus I.
4. Practice OOP fundamentals with practical software projects.
5. Learn how to communicate my programs better with diagrams and schematics. 
6. Read *Clean Code*. 

## Timeline Breakdown 
### From Start to Finish 
From my official 'lock-in' date of September 1st, 2024 to my 30th birthday, there are:

- 8.7 years
- 105 months
- 458 weeks
- 3,209 days

Breaking that down by hours, you get:

| | Year | Month | Week | Day
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
| **Totals** | 8.7 | 105 | 458 | 3,209
| **Hours Per** | 1,138 | 95 | 21.8 | 3.12

So already, this seems pretty doable (sarcasm doesn't translate well to Markdown).

### In the Day-to-Day 
Given the constraints of school and work, I will have to manage my time wisely! As such, I'll be adopting the following weekly schedule:

Weekdays | Weekends | Total
:---: | :---: | :---:
2 hours/day | 6 hours/day | 22 hours/week

Hopefully I'll  be able to devote more time on some days towards this weekly total so I can have some buffer room for busier days.
