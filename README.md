# Mastery Tracker

## Purpose
Before I turn 35 years old, I want to complete **_10,000 hours_** of focused study/practice in computer programming.

## Motivation
### What it Comes Down to 
I want to master the craft of developing software. 

### Background
10,000 hours is a lot! So what the *heck* makes me think I can take on this enormous journey and why do I even want to?

Well, here's the short of it:

I have a passion for creating software. I believe dedicating myself to this discipline will be transformative for me, and not just as a programmer. I see it as a way to construct a beautiful life for myself by fusing my interests into a life-long career.

## Goals
### General Overview
For as lofty as completing the 10,000 hours before 35 is, my goals are even broader.

I have wide-ranging interests that I'd like to connect through software. These include:
- Tennis & Basketball
- Physical Fitness
- Math & Physics
- Electronics
- Languages
- Travelling
- Piano
- Aviation

By completing projects in these domains and continually improving myself as a developer, I believe I will ultimately make tangible use of a passion I've refined. And beyond that, maybe I'll be able to help others out and meet new people along the way!

## Timeline Breakdown 
### From Start to Finish
