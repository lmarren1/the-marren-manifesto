            <p><span class="color"><b>Initial Notes: </b></span>
                This week, I want to continue progressing towards the first two goals I outlined in the README: improve my use of version control with git and GitHub and create small data science projects using Python, R, Excel, and Tableau.
                I count this mastery tracker's backend as being data sciency and I've been trying to write better commits.
                Something I could do is create another repo to practice pull requests, merges, and all that other stuff that's important to know when working with a team.
                I'm very excited to continue this process! 
                Only thing is I'm growing impatient and <i>really</i> want to see my progress metrics ASAP, so I may skip creating some scripts and just make a 'visualize' script for plotting my hours.

                Cleaned up and pushed all local commits to GitHub (I know, it's not much).
                Prepared website for this week.

                Start visualization script!!!
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                Super excited to start the visualization script tomorrow!
                Plotly graphs are so cool and I love playing around with visualizations.
                Maybe in the future I'll switch to creating my own JS plots to optimize my site's speed.
                For now, though, I'll stick to improving what I know.

            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: </span>N/A</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Today's Accomplishments: </span></b>
                Plotted simple graph in base plotly (plotly.graph_objects instead of the express version).
                Learned about how relative file paths are determined (bracing myself to be even more humbled than this).
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Tomorrow's Goals: </span></b>
                Consolidate CSVs to a single CSVs.
                Change time_logger.py to reflect that ^.
                Learn more about how to use plotly.go and make some more graphs!
                Embed a graph in index.html!
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                I had zero motivation coming into this.
                I'm working really late on a different time zone, so I came in lacking energy.
                I was heavily debating leaving this until tomorrow and then I thought, "There'll be no days off come September 1st for the next 10 years or so, so what are you doing breaking a week-old habit this early?"
                That thought really pushed me into action.
                I willed my way through about two hours worth of troubleshooting and learning plotly basics.
                I need to get real with myself and realize that this is what a large part of the work may be like - a grind.
                I may come in unmotivated, lacking energy, and convincing myself that I can just do this the next day; however, in retrospect that has no influence on how much I love to program and learn about programming.
                It's imperative I keep that in mind. 
                I love this and I am willing to go to great lengths to improve at it.

                Created Plotly graph visualizing cumulative hours spent towards mastery.
                Learned more about plotly.go's structure and why I should venture into JS for webpage plotting.
                Consolidated the CSVs into one main CSV.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Tomorrow's Goals: </span></b>
                Figure out how to embed plotly graphs in HTML without sacrificing their interactivity.
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                It might be advantageous to learn Dash for making plotly apps, just like how you use RShiny for ggplot analytics apps.
                This is why I prefer using R. 
                I'm almost certain that using the 'knit' button in Rstudio does all the conversion to HTML for you.
                Learning plotly via JS would be great for making webpage data visualizations.
                I feel like I should focus on learning more intuitive visualization tools like tableau first.
                This is good!
                I've got ideas for the future and I'm feeling more motivated than before.
