                I'm so excited to start working on this project!
                It's been a long time coming and I've finally stopped making excuses and have gotten to work.
                I know it'll be a grind from here on out, so we'll see what my outlook is like in a month.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Reflecting Notes: </b></span>
                First week's in the books!
                I'm still really, really excited about everything. 
                I've already learned lots about points where I need to improve and topics that I previously knew little about.
                Going forward, I'd like these posts to be a little more goal-oriented, specifically towards the goals I outlined in the README of this repo.
                I'd also like to add some color to this; I want to treat this as a sort of work journal that has some character to it.
                Oh well.
                This website will evolve from the bare bones I've laid out so far into something special. 
                On to week two!

            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: </span>15.89</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                I started last night (8-3), so this accounts for both today and yesterday.
                I've been working on basic HTML, CSS, and some JS for this site.
                As a non-arts major, I think I beautified the <i>hell</i> out of this.
                I feel so good starting the 10,000 hour process that I've been seen kicking my feet smiling today.
                I just feel like this could really turn things around for me and give me something to feel good about,
                regardless of its real-world outcomes.
                Feeling capable is a pretty crazy feeling.

            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: 2.12</span>N/A</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                Today's a much busier day than yesterday, so my progress here will be limited.
                Got a lot of solid hours in yesterday, though, and I'm happy with the basic functionality of the website
                and of my data collection.
                Going forward I want to: add cool interactive graphs to the homepage,
                pull the hours/timeline of these posts from the data CSVs,
                make a script that automates the template for weekly blog posts like this,
                pull the cumulative hours from the data CSVs onto the homepage,
                make it so that the latest weekly post appears on the homepage (automate that).
                I've got some work ahead of me! I'm excited!

            <h3>Tuesday, 8-6</h3>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: 0.75</span>N/A</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                Today was exceptionally busy, so I only got to put in about 20 minutes.
                The reason I started this project now rather than on the 'lock-in' date of September 1st was so that I
                could start building consistent habits prior to the actual goal-oriented timeline starting.
                Clearly, I will have to dig deeper and find more time going forward if I am to be dedicated to the
                10,000 hours.
                That being said, I'm still in a good place and am still excited and full of ideas for the future.
                Patience in the macro and eagerness in the micro are the two things I'm trying to build here early on.

            <h3>Wednesday, 8-7</h3>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: 3.71</span>N/A</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Today's Accomplishments: </span></b>
                Learned python's PEP standards.
                Altered time-logger.py's structure to improve readability and streamline function.
                Implemented update_docstring.py with a .git/pre-commit hook to track file version.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Tomorrow's Goals: </span></b>
                Finalize update_docstring.py.
                Start plotly graph creator script.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                I'm learning a lot about how to properly structure Python scripts according to PEP standards.
                I think before I start creating more complex scripts and series of scripts, I need to ensure readability
                and clear structure.
                I'm using Black as my Python formatter now and it's doing wonders.
                I often make the mistake of rushing into script-writing before I even know what I want the program to
                accomplish, so being really on-top of my program's structure and asserting its purpose early on is a big
                step in the right direction.
                Just a heads-up, I will be playing around with the structure of these posts somewhat to see what might
                work best for quality reflection down the road.
                I've included accomplishments and goals sections to go along with the notes.
                Hopefully this will make it clear to the reader what I've been working on instead of just how I'm
                feeling about what I'm working on.

        <article id="Thursday">
            <h3>Thursday, 8-8</h3>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Hours: 3.46</span>N/A</b></p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Today's Accomplishments: </span></b>
                Wrote great commit messages.
                Relearning how to use pandas.
                Almost done with load_data() - which is 1/6th of the way to completing time_logger_analysis.py.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Tomorrow's Goals: </span></b>
                Continue working on time_logger_analysis.py.
                Add a function/functions to time_logger.py that lets you manipulate all of the CSVs directly when changes need to be made.
            </p>
            <p><span class="color"><b>Notes: </span></b>
                My commit messages are awful. 
                Reading through them is an eyesore and a headache combined.
                So, today, I'm going to write better commits, be more selective with what I choose to commit, and begin writing the plotly graph script.
                Update: I figure there's no reason to have 2 scripts when I can combine them and just do the entire data analysis process in one main() call.
                So that's what I'm going to do. 
                This script is going to be massive, so maybe I'll break it up later.
                It's gonna take a few days to finish at the pace I'm going/with the time I have.
                I so much prefer R to pandas.
                It's much cleaner, much more intuitive, and much more customizable. 
                It's good to know both, though, so a part of me is glad to be able to use pandas for data analysis.

                Man oh man. 
                I'm realizing the rabbit-hole I'm digging myself by attempting to put my own spin on the data analysis process with this project.
                It started off as "Oh, I'll just make some CSVs to track my progress and then plot them" and now it's basically turning into me making a Python module.
                This is good experience! 
                I guess this 10,000 hours experience is meant to be filled with off-the-beaten-path work.
